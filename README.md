# PROJECT NAME

jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Challenge_

Over the weekend I took on the challenge of creating a employee slaray calculator. In this project you will be able to submit employee data and monitor a monthly budget that live calculates off of your collective employee salaries. 

In this employee roster you will also have the ability to delete employees after they have been entered. I eneded up using a loop to remake the table with every input. Given my current knowledge and time constrainst I was unable to get the monthly budget to update on deletion of an employee. 

## Installation

Check out the index.html to view this project.

## Usage
How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

1. Submit employee data to the table below using the form
2. Observe monthly budget among each submission
3. Try not to go over budget!
4. Remember you can always delete if you make a mistake (though budget will remain unchanged)


## Built With

_jQuery, js, css, plus lots of help and encouragement_
